#Based on my analysis of the upload endpoint at app/api/v1/upload.py:41-91 and its supporting
#  infrastructure, here are the areas that are incomplete or missing:
#
#  Critical Missing Implementations
#
#  1. Rate Limiting Enforcement (app/api/v1/upload.py:41)
#
#  - Domain exceptions include RateLimitExceededError but no actual rate limiting middleware is
#  implemented at the API layer
#  - Tenant quotas exist in models but missing request-level rate limiting
#  - No protection against abuse or DDoS attacks
#
#  2. Webhook URL Validation (app/api/v1/upload.py:45)
#
#  - Webhook URL parameter accepts any string value ("string" in your curl)
#  - No URL format validation, scheme checking, or domain restrictions
#  - No webhook signature verification mechanism
#  - Could allow SSRF attacks via malicious URLs
#
#  3. Processing Cancellation Logic (app/application/upload_service.py:492)
#
#  - cancel_processing method contains TODO comment: "integrate with actual cancellation mechanics"
#  - Currently returns mock response without stopping background tasks
#  - No actual job termination capability
#
#  4. File Cleanup Mechanism
#
#  - No temporary file cleanup after processing completion/failure
#  - File content is loaded into memory (app/application/upload_service.py:117) but no cleanup of file
#  handles
#  - Potential memory leaks with large files
#
#  5. Audit Logging Implementation (app/services/auth/authentication_service.py:582)
#
#  - AuditLog model exists but audit storage is not implemented (contains pass statement)
#  - No tracking of file upload activities
#  - Missing compliance trail for document processing
#
#  Incomplete Error Handling
#
#  6. Domain Exception Mapping (app/api/dependencies.py:80)
#
#  - DomainValidationError referenced in mapping but not defined in domain exceptions
#  - Several domain exceptions (DocumentNotFoundError, ConfigurationError) not mapped to HTTP codes
#  - Inconsistent error response formats
#
#  7. Background Task Error Recovery
#
#  - No retry mechanism for failed embeddings generation (app/application/upload_service.py:601)
#  - Limited error recovery for webhook delivery failures
#  - Background task failures may leave inconsistent state
#
#  Security & Operational Gaps
#
#  8. File Size Validation
#
#  - Size checking only occurs if file.size attribute exists (app/application/upload_service.py:788)
#  - No stream-based size validation during upload
#  - Potential for memory exhaustion
#
#  9. Content-Type Validation
#
#  - Only filename extension validation, no MIME type verification
#  - No file content signature checking (magic bytes)
#  - Could allow malicious files with valid extensions
#
#  10. Progress Tracking Limitations
#
#  - Processing status only tracks basic states (app/application/upload_service.py:310-317)
#  - No real-time progress updates during processing
#  - No ETA calculations beyond basic file size estimation
#
#  11. Webhook Delivery Reliability
#
#  - No retry mechanism for failed webhook deliveries
#  - No dead letter queue for failed notifications
#  - Webhook failures logged but not persisted for retry
#
#  12. Resource Management
#
#  - No connection pooling configuration visible for external services
#  - No timeout configuration for document processing operations
#  - No circuit breaker pattern for external service failures
#
#  Missing Operational Features
#
#  13. Monitoring & Observability
#
#  - No metrics collection for upload success/failure rates
#  - No performance monitoring for processing duration trends
#  - Limited structured logging for operational insights
#
#  14. Tenant Resource Isolation
#
#  - Quota checking exists but no enforcement of processing resource limits
#  - No tenant-specific retry policies or processing priorities
#  - No tenant-level webhook configuration validation
#
#  The endpoint has a solid foundation but requires significant work in security validation, operational
#   reliability, error recovery, and resource management to be production-complete.
